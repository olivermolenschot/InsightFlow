# InsightFlow
InsightFlow is an end-to-end ML project that ingests your training data, trains a model, and offers both a REST API and a CLI for real-time inference. It’s designed to demonstrate the entire machine learning pipeline—data collection, model training, and deployment-ready prediction endpoints—in a single, cohesive tool.
